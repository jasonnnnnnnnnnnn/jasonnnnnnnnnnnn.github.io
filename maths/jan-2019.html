        <p>Cross simplication, i used cross simplication for addition and subtration which wrong. 
            I was meant to simplify each fraction only then add or subtract.
            You can only cross simplify if the operation symbol is multiplication. 
        </p>
        <p>LCD, i had to find the LCD first then multiply the denominator, instead of
            multiplying the denominators before finding the LCD which i did.
