    <p>Most of the questions were simple but difficult, especially the complex fraction which took alot of time to find the answer.
         To find the LCD of two numbers, you would need to divide a number divisible to the two numbers and multiply them all.
         I had to watch a another video for zero in the numerator and the denominator, if zero is in the numerator, the answer is zero 
         and if zero is in the denominator the answer is undefined. One major mistake i did which made my life difficult was that i forgot to 
         simplify the fraction before i evaluated the question<p>
